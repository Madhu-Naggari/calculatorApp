💡 Code Philosophy

“Anyone can write code in many lines.
But not everyone can focus on avoiding unwanted code.”

This calculator was built with a clean coding approach in mind:
	•	Minimal DOM interactions
	•	No unused logic
	•	Elegant and efficient

The entire calculator works with just 25 lines of JavaScript, making it easy to understand, maintain, and scale.
